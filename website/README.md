### About

djs-framework is a Framework built on top of discord.js Library, a powerful Node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend.

- Object-oriented
- Predictable abstractions
- Performant
- 100% coverage of the Discord API

### Installation

**Node.js 16.11.0 or newer version is required.**

```
$ npm install @almostjohn/djs-framework discord.js
$ yard add @almostjohn/djs-framework discord.js
```

### Required Packages

- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) â€” this is the main library for using the framework.

### Example Usage

Install discord.js along with the framework.

```
$ npm install @almostjohn/djs-framework discord.js
$ yard add @almostjohn/djs-framework discord.js
```

Register a slash command against the Discord API:

```ts
import { REST, Routes } from "discord.js";

const commands = [
	{
		name: "ping",
		description: "Replies with pong",
	},
];

const rest = new REST({ version: "10" }).setToken(TOKEN);

try {
	console.log("Started refreshing interaction (/) commands");

	await rest.put(Routes.applicationCommands(CLIENT_ID), { body: commands });

	console.log("Successfully reloaded interaction (/) commands");
} catch (error) {
	console.error(error);
}
```

Afterwards we can create a quite simple Discord bot.

```ts
import { GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";
import { createClient } from "@almostjohn/djs-framework";

const client = createClient({
	intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages],
});

client.login(TOKEN);
```

So we create a simple bot, however I'm not gonna cover the process for making a command handler, instead I'll show how to use the `Command` class that handle the function for you.

```ts
import { Command } from "@almostjohn/djs-framework";
import type { ArgsParam, InteractionParam, LocaleParam } from "@almostjohn/djs-framework";

const pingCommand = [
	{
		name: "ping",
		description: "Replies with pong.",
	},
];

export default class extends Command<typeof pingCommand> {
	public override async chatInput(
		interaction: InteractionParam,
		_args: ArgsParam<typeof pingCommand>,
		_locale: LocaleParam,
	): Promise<void> {
		await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });
		await interaction.editReply({ content: "Pong!" });
	}
}
```
